- 😁 Hi, I’m @huan161299, also goes as @KE_Darkness. People usually call me Huan or KE for short. 
- 🌱 Welcome to this respiratory! I am currently practicing my skills as a competitive programmer and a game developer. This is my first respiratory update, so don't be too harsh on it. I will try my best to keep it update!
- 🚀 I am actively searching for a Software Engineer (or related) position. You can see my profile here on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/huan-c-tran-81184b195/). I am working on my resume (will post it here!) 🔥
- 📫 If you want to give me an update about something (co-op project for example), feel free to reach me here: huan161299@gmail.com.
